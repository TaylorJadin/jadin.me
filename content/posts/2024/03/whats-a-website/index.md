Today my 4 year old asked me about what I was working on. And I said “I’m working on a project, a website.”

She then asked “what’s a website?”

🤯🤯🤯 … like of course she wouldn’t know that, but I had very little idea how to explain that to her! I also of course found the question hilarous. I said “it’s some thing that you use on a computer, phone, or tablet.”

She then asked, “like a charger?”

And the best clarification I could come back was “No, you read it.”

The line of questioning continued. 

As a person who is deeply personally invested in the web, I highly recommend talking to a 4 year old about what websites are, with very little prior knowledge, no jargon, and no visual aid.
