It is so cool to see how far MuseScore has come.

When I was in college, using the open-source [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) was fully not an option between its bugs, and the quality of playback and the fiddliness of making anything legible. The idea of using it for anything serious was practically a joke. Even for simple stuff like I was doing, it would have been a huge time sink, so I saved up for a copy of Finale.

I suspect that MakeMusic, the company behind Finale, know that the alternatives are getting good too. The academic price [is apparently now $99](https://store.makemusic.com/Store/default.aspx?tab=notation) for the software. When I bought it in 2013 it was more like $300 if memory serves.[^1]

[^1]: Ok, so actually I looked it up on the Wayback machine, and [it used to be $350 for the academic discount](https://web.archive.org/web/20130429234330/https://store.makemusic.com/Store/default.aspx)!

Its great to see this video break down the design challenges, and how they were overcome. I would definitely use this the next time I need music notation software.[^2] I really hope making these tools easier to get your hands on and easier to use will lower the barrier of entry for budding composers!

[^2]: Admittedly, I don't need notation software very often anymore, but my point still stands!
