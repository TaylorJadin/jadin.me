It is so cool to see how far MuseScore has come.

When I was in college using the open-source MuseScore was fully not an option between its bugs, and the quality of playback and engraving. The idea of using it for anything serious was practically a joke. Even for simple stuff like I was doing, it would have been a huge time sink, so I saved up for a copy of Finale.

Its great to see this video break down the design challenges, and how they were overcome. I would definitely use this the next time I need Notation software, which admittedly is not something I need very often anymore, but still! Maybe this gets more students into composition at an earlier age too!k
