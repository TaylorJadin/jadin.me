I got an the beta invite for [Arc](https://arc.net/) and I think I'm going to kick the tires on it for a week as my main browser. So far, I'd say it has some really smart ideas and genuinely really useful features, but I think some of its opinions on browsing workflows probably won't stick with me long-term.

I like the way the address bar and pinned tabs work, [Easels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukquBSOpmTk&t=476s) are genius, and [Boosts](https://youtu.be/53KQ2wUZG2s) have a ton of potential. That being said, so far I'm left just wishing Easels and Boosts were extensions I could add to Firefox.[^1]

[^1]: I suppose Boosts is kinda like Stylebot plus it adds the ability to inject custom Javascript.

It'll be hard to peel me away from Firefox and the [Multi-Account containers extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/). Account containers and Firefox's customizable UI have finally switched me off Chrome earlier this year, and I don't see me switching back. Not to mention using a browser that isn't based on Chromium gives me warm fuzzies. On top of all that, there is no Windows version, so it seems really unlikely I'd change my browsing habits on macOS but not on Windows.

If you haven't heard of Arc, these two videos from the [A Better Computer](https://www.youtube.com/@ABetterComputer) channel on YouTube do a great job diving into it isat is and how it works:
