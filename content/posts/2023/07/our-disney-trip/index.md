June 11th through the 17th Abby, my parents, Nat, and I all took a trip down to Disney World, and I'm finally getting around to posting some pictures here. Nat absolutely loved it, and it was amazing watching a 4-year-old experience all this!

## Monday: Magic Kingdom
On Monday (our first day in the parks) we went to the Magic Kingdom. We did quite a lot on our first day. Nat got to meet several Princesses, which she was over the moon about. The Carousel was an early favorite for her, and we got to come back at night for the fireworks!

## Tuesday: EPCOT

Tuesday we went to EPCOT, which is probably my personal favorite park both for the World Showcase stuff, and the general sort of retro-futuristic vibe.

## Wednesday: Disney Springs
On Wednesday we sort of took a day off and headed to the Disney Springs area for a while, then in the evening Abby and I went out, just the two of us, for dinner to celebrate our anniversary.

## Thursday: Magic Kingdom pt. 2

On Thursday we actually did a second day at the Magic Kingdom so Nat so we could do a few rides and so Nat could do the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique! Abby and I also took the opportunity to go do a few rides on our own, including Haunted Mansion and Tron Lightcycle Run (which blew my mind).

## Friday: Hollywood Studios

Friday we went to Hollywood Studios! Highlights for me here were definitely were taking Nat on the Slinky Dog and seeing the Star Wars Galaxy's Edge area. Nat's first roller coaster was actually the Barnstormer on Thursday, but I was surprised by how fast Slinky Dog was. She did great!
