It's been over a month, but I'm finally getting around to writing about Reclaim Open. Reading [Tim's post on his pinball streaming rig for Reclaim Arcade](https://blog.timowens.io/building-a-streaming-rig/) has inspired me to start with the streaming / recording setups we used for Reclaim Open and how that all came together! 

From the early stages of planning Reclaim Open we knew that we would want to do *some* kind of recording of the sessions and keynotes, but we weren't 100% sure what we were going to be able to pull off given we would have to pack and bring any necessary equipment to UMW for the week of the conference.

My goal was to capture the presenters on camera, as well as capture their screen to get any demos, slides, or videos they were showing. Finally, I wanted some kind of mic setup, so the presenters sounded their best, as bad audio can really ruin any recording. That really comes down to two video feeds, and a mix of up to 4 microphones per room (we had a few panel presentations to record).

Not being able to truly test things out in the space you are going to be in makes anything recording-related difficult and nerve-racking. I do something like this at home (but with just one microphone) all the time using OBS and Streamyard for Reclaim EdTech events, but this would be a lot trickier to do at the conference across three different rooms. On top of that as much as [I](https://jadin.me/understanding-containers-debrief/) [like](https://jadin.me/starting-obs-with-streamdeck/) [OBS](https://jadin.me/obs-and-streaming-youtubers/) [and](https://video.jadin.me/w/72HZva353wxGsbq5XcQkC2) [what](https://video.jadin.me/w/qQ9FinbCcoNV6gMhEVUoon) [it](https://video.jadin.me/w/9C1qadVNSQibH3tNHYgg5E) [can](https://video.jadin.me/w/4uYeLWmqy3p8zvVeqYwtLQ) [do](https://video.jadin.me/w/eiJvR4FKwLK2c1rFHyKFbE), we weren't going to have a bunch of spare laptops, nor would we have the time to train a team of people to operate a complicated OBS setup in each room.
