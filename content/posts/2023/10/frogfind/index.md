I was watching this Action Retro video where he installs Red Hat Linux 5.2 on a Pentium system. Its cool stuff! 

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsAHi7t4Cj8?si=cNZlrJlpusc3Keg2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

That being said, the real gold for me was him referencing this search engine that he runs for use with retro computers, [FrogFind!](http://frogfind.com/)

It loads over plain old HTTP, and has a simple layout, so it works with ancient browsers, but even cooler than that, when you click on a result it loads in a simplified version of the page right, this way you can actually read the content of modern websites from an old browser!

Here's an example. This is an article about Alan Wake 2 on Polygon I found on FrogFind:

And here is the real page:
