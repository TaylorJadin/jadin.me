## Family stuff

Nat has been really in to horses lately, so we brought her to a place near Sturgeon Bay to do a quick ride around the arena, she really liked it! Weâ€™re also in town to go out to dinner with my parents for my momâ€™s birthday!

In our downtime today my dad has been using the [Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) app to play bird noises in their backyard and identity birds they can hear, Natalie is OBSESSED with birds lately because Grandpa and her have been doing this once in a while. Its cool to see such a well-done, totally free app, [come from an organization like this](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/the-story/).

## Games

I finished up the main campaign of Rollerdrome. Loved it. Iâ€™m still playing Yakuza Kiwami and its still wacky as hell. That game is pretty long, so Iâ€™ll probably be playing it for a while. Iâ€™m dipping back in to Destiny 2 as I do once or twice a year. Itâ€™s always hard to get back up to speed with that game, and as a very occasional player I never really full do get back up to speed, particularly because I donâ€™t have a group I play with to do some of the dungeons and raid stuff that require it. Iâ€™ve had nice friends who are more into Destiny than me offer but Iâ€™ve never taken folks up on it because I know its likely I wonâ€™t be committed to playing long-term and often. Fundamentally parts of that game just arenâ€™t for me even if I find the loop and the story compelling, but thats OK.

## Work things

We just finished up our [Headless WordPress workshop](https://reclaimed.tech/headless-wordpress/welcome/#), and Iâ€™m really jazzed to try and do some stuff with the things I learned from Jeff and Tom there. Iâ€™m also working on documentation on how to run [Flask apps](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) on Reclaim Cloud which is something we get asked about occasionally. Iâ€™ve got a [basic Hello World site](https://github.com/TaylorJadin/hello-world-flask), but want to try and set up the Flask documentationâ€™s turorial app, [flaskr](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/) as well. Iâ€™m learning a lot, and I would say python is my most comfortable language, but Iâ€™m not sure if I personally dig Flask yet. Maybe once I get through the tutorial I will. 

Iâ€™ve been helping a lot of folks this week troubleshoot slow WordPress sites, and I think I want to make a continuously updated list of my favorite WP plugins that I would publish here and keep updated. We at Reclaim have some recommendations that we make in our documentation, but having my own personal list may be helpful, even just as a reference for myself.

## Publishing my hugo blog from iOS

I wrote this one mostly from my phone and iPad using [Notion](https://www.notion.so), [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/), and the iOS Shortcuts app while me and the family stayed at my parentâ€™s place in Sturgeon Bay this weekend. I mostly did the draft in Notion (just cuz, I could have done the whole thing Working Copy as it has an excellent Markdown editor built-in) and then moved it over in to Working Copy which is an excellent git client for iOS. I still need to do a proper post on my workflow for using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) on Reclaim Hosting, but basically GitHub is the sync client that gets files to my account. The site then gets built there by running hugo on the server, so having a good git client on iOS is useful for the rare occasions Iâ€™m blogging from something other than my computer. When Iâ€™m ready to publish from iOS I could use ssh to log in to my cPanel account and [run my build script](https://github.com/TaylorJadin/jadin.me/blob/main/build), but a long time ago I set up a Shortcut on iOS to trigger that script with a simple tap of a button, its neat!
