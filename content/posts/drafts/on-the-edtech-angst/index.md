All the cool kids are getting in on blogging on the EdTech angst, including some Reclaimers. The discussion all started with Audrey‚Äôs post of the end of Hack Education and stepping away from edtech. I am one many, many people who have followed Audrey‚Äôs work and that work has played a large role in demonstrating to me the value of a critical perspective of technology in my field of choice, edtech, even from an early point in my career.

From that announcement has sprouted lots of blogging on the state of edtech (as well as blogging about blogging about the state of edtech). I‚Äôm making a (probably incomplete) list here, mostly for my own purposes. A better writer would, you know, contextually link to things ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[As Jim notes](https://bavatuesdays.com/the-blogsphere-is-hot-with-edtech-angst/), the [blogsphere is hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12yD8JyaVvY), and it's pretty cool to see so many people I respect writing and commenting
