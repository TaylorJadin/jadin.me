All the cool kids are blogging about the EdTech angst, including some Reclaimers. The discussion all started with Audrey Watters‚Äôs post on the end of Hack Education and stepping away from edtech. I, like many others, have followed Audrey‚Äôs work for a while, and that work has played a pretty big role in demonstrating to me the value of a critical perspective of technology in my field of choice, edtech, from an early point in my career.

From that announcement has sprouted lots of blogging on the state of edtech (as well as blogging about blogging about the state of edtech). I‚Äôm making a list of links I've come across, as well as links to [Stephen Downes's OLDaily](https://www.downes.ca/news/OLDaily.htm) (represented by üê¶), mostly for my own purposes. A better writer would, you know, contextually link to things ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I'll do some of that, but I also like a good list of links, so here we go:

[As Jim says](https://bavatuesdays.com/the-blogsphere-is-hot-with-edtech-angst/), the [blogsphere is hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12yD8JyaVvY), and it's pretty cool to look at the list above and see so much discussion. Is this what blogging in 2008 was like?

## I'm Not Okay (I Promise)

I can't help it, but thinking of the mid-to-late-aughts and "angst" reminds me of some of the music I listened to in high school and middle school, the emo/pop punk hybrid that by the end of high school I would have been ashamed to admit I once liked. Now as an adult entering his 30's, I enjoy revisiting it with the help of equal amounts nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek-y-ness.

Oh yeah, I'm talking about My Chemical Romance.[^1]

[^1]: and bands like them, I guess.

As Amanda said, [You want (edtech) angst? Take it from a millennial.](https://www.amanda-wentworth-schmidt.com/mandas-musings/millennial-take-on-edtech/) I'd consider myself an optimistic person, but that optimism survived (was forged in?) high school and teenage hormones, feeling like an outsider, low-self esteem, and the now hilarious thought that only I knew what it felt like to experience those problems. In many ways, this brand of pop-punk-emo-alt-rock[^2] helped (I think) as an outlet.

All of this has little point other than to say, "hey um, my blog post has a theme and a soundtrack, so thats fun," and to explain the mood I'm in while writing. I'd typically not throw my 2 cents in on stuff like this at all, even though I care a lot about it, because what I have to say is said better by the people in the posts linked above.

[^2]: In general, it's a pandering sub-genre that knew its audience. At least MCR feels pretty self-aware and self-deprecating with its album concepts that [perhaps unsuprisingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umbrella_Academy) feel like they were ripped from a comic book.

## So Long & Goodnight
A lot of the discussion has been around some variation of the question, "is edtech dead?" which Audrey never technically asked or answered, but is a natural follow up given [the content of her original post](https://hackeducation.com/2022/06/15/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish):

> For a long, long time, if anyone asked me if there was any ed-tech I  liked ‚Äî and I would get this question a lot, often asked as though it  was some sort of "gotcha" ‚Äî I'd reply in a heartbeat, "Desmos."
>
> [...]
>
> Now that the company has been acquired, I don't have an answer when  someone asks me that "gotcha" question. You got me: "Nope. There's not a goddamn thing." And that certainly means it's time for me to step away  from ed-tech for good.

I think this is what Jim is mostly responding to in his first post, [Is Edtech Dead?](https://bavatuesdays.com/is-edtech-dead/):
> Am I working in a Reclaim bubble? I remain very much compelled by the work we do in this ‚Äúdead‚Äù field, and I have not abandoned all hope just yet.

Where the money comes from matters, whether we like it or not, and that post and [Jim' next one](https://bavatuesdays.com/thinking-about-edtech/) drive it home.

Then Alan Levine [points out in the comments](https://bavatuesdays.com/thinking-about-edtech/) and [in his own post](https://cogdogblog.com/2022/07/edtech-who-are-you/) the difference between Edtech (capital E) and edtech. Going with Alan's definition, I don't want anything to do with captial E Edtech if I can help it. I'm pretty sure that big-money Edtech is not actually going anywhere, but if it was up to me, I'd say "so long" to that Edtech.
