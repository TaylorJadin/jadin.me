All the cool kids are getting in on blogging on the EdTech angst, including some Reclaimers. The discussion all started with Audrey‚Äôs post of the end of Hack Education and stepping away from edtech. I am one many, many people who have followed Audrey‚Äôs work and that work has played a large role in demonstrating to me the value of a critical perspective of technology in my field of choice, edtech, even from an early point in my career.

From that announcement has sprouted lots of blogging on the state of edtech (as well as blogging about blogging about the state of edtech). I‚Äôm making a (probably incomplete) list here, mostly for my own purposes. A better writer would, you know, contextually link to things ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. We'll do some of that, but I like a good list of links, so here it is:

[As Jim says](https://bavatuesdays.com/the-blogsphere-is-hot-with-edtech-angst/), the [blogsphere is hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12yD8JyaVvY), and it's pretty cool to look at the list above and see so much discussion (all from people who's work I admire). Is this what the blogsphere of 2008 was like?

## I'm Not Okay (I Promise)

I can't help it, but thinking of the mid-to-late-aughts and angst brings me to music I listened to in high school and middle school, the emo/pop punk hybrid that by high school graduation I would have been ashamed to admit I once liked, but now as an adult entering his 30's enjoys coming back to with the help of equal amounts nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek-y-ness.

Oh yeah, we are talking about My Chemical Romance.[^1]

[^1]: Connecting this metaphor even further, MCR pretty much went on hiatus in 2011, and came back in 2019.

As Amanda said, [You want (edtech) angst? Take it from a millennial.](https://www.amanda-wentworth-schmidt.com/mandas-musings/millennial-take-on-edtech/) 

I'd consider myself an optimistic person, but that optimism was forged through the fires of teenage hormones, feeling like an outsider, generally low-self esteem, feeling like only I experienced those problems, and just generally having little perspective of myself or my place in the world. In many ways, this brand of pop-punk-emo-alt-rock[^2] helped (I think, maybe).

## Dead!

A lot of the discussion has been around some variation of the question, "is edtech dead?" which of course Audrey never specifically asked or answered, but is obviously prompted by part of her post:

[The End - hackeducation.com](https://hackeducation.com/2022/06/15/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish)

> For a long, long time, if anyone asked me if there was any ed-tech I  liked ‚Äî and I would get this question a lot, often asked as though it  was some sort of "gotcha" ‚Äî I'd reply in a heartbeat, "Desmos."

> Now that the company has been acquired, I don't have an answer when  someone asks me that "gotcha" question. You got me: "Nope. There's not a goddamn thing." And that certainly means it's time for me to step away  from ed-tech for good.
