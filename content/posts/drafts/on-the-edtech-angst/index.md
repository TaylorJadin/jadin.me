All the cool kids are blogging about the EdTech angst, including some Reclaimers. The discussion all started with Audrey Watters‚Äôs post on the end of Hack Education and stepping away from edtech. I, like many others, have followed Audrey‚Äôs work for a while, and that work has played a pretty big role in demonstrating to me the value of a critical perspective of technology in my field of choice, edtech, from an early point in my career.

From that announcement has sprouted lots of blogging on the state of edtech (as well as blogging about blogging about the state of edtech). I‚Äôm making a list of links I've come across, as well as links to [Stephen Downes's OLDaily](https://www.downes.ca/news/OLDaily.htm) (represented by üê¶), mostly for my own purposes. A better writer would, you know, contextually link to things ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I'll do some of that, but I also like a good list of links, so here we go:

[As Jim says](https://bavatuesdays.com/the-blogsphere-is-hot-with-edtech-angst/), the [blogsphere is hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12yD8JyaVvY), and it's pretty cool to look at the list above and see so much discussion. Is this what blogging in 2008 was like?

## I'm Not Okay (I Promise)

I can't help it, but thinking of the mid-to-late-aughts and "angst" reminds me of some of the music I listened to in high school and middle school, the emo/pop punk hybrid that by the end of high school I would have been ashamed to admit I once liked. Now as an adult entering his 30's, I enjoy revisiting it with the help of equal amounts nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek-y-ness.

Oh yeah, I'm talking about My Chemical Romance.[^1]

[^1]: and bands like them, I guess.

As Amanda said, [You want (edtech) angst? Take it from a millennial.](https://www.amanda-wentworth-schmidt.com/mandas-musings/millennial-take-on-edtech/) I'd consider myself an optimistic person, but that optimism survived (was forged in?) high school and [teenage](https://youtu.be/k6EQAOmJrbw) hormones, feeling like an outsider, low-self esteem, and the now hilarious thought that only I knew what it felt like to experience those problems. In many ways, this brand of pop-punk-emo-alt-rock[^2] helped (I think) as an outlet.

All of this has little point other than to say, "hey um, my blog post has a theme and a soundtrack, so thats fun," and to explain the mood I'm in while writing. I'd typically not throw my 2 cents in on stuff like this at all, even though I care a lot about it, because what I have to say is said better by the people in the posts linked above.

[^2]: In general, it's a pandering sub-genre that knew its audience. At least MCR feels pretty self-aware and self-deprecating with its album concepts that [perhaps unsuprisingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umbrella_Academy) feel like they were ripped from a comic book.

## So Long & Goodnight
A lot of the discussion has been around some variation of the question, "is edtech dead?" which Audrey never technically asked nor answered, but is a natural one given [the content of her original post](https://hackeducation.com/2022/06/15/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish):

> For a long, long time, if anyone asked me if there was any ed-tech I  liked ‚Äî and I would get this question a lot, often asked as though it  was some sort of "gotcha" ‚Äî I'd reply in a heartbeat, "Desmos."
>
> [...]
>
> Now that the company has been acquired, I don't have an answer when  someone asks me that "gotcha" question. You got me: "Nope. There's not a goddamn thing." And that certainly means it's time for me to step away  from ed-tech for good.

I think this is what Jim is mostly responding to in his first post, [Is Edtech Dead?](https://bavatuesdays.com/is-edtech-dead/)
> Am I working in a Reclaim bubble? I remain very much compelled by the work we do in this ‚Äúdead‚Äù field, and I have not abandoned all hope just yet.

In my opinion, the best edtech is the kind that operates in an exploratory space, but one that is not driven by share-holder priorities first and foremost [as Jim talks about in his follow up:](https://bavatuesdays.com/thinking-about-edtech/)

> There are a lot of edtechs, in the true sense of that word for me, that have willingly resisted the lure of exchanging cachet for cash. Folks who continue to good work, edtechs that I deeply respect who reside far from the maddening crowd of the financials of firms that have little to no interest in the transformative power of augmenting teaching and learning‚Äîdespite the claims they make. Edtech as an approach that is exploratory, experimental, and creative, not to mention generous and unbolted to the logic of licensing and litigation. That‚Äôs my edtech, and I like it.

Then Alan Levine points out in the comments and [in his own post](https://cogdogblog.com/2022/07/edtech-who-are-you/) the difference between Edtech (capital E) and edtech (lower-case E):

> There you go, you had to come here to find out that the Edtech [capitalized] is really the Devil. And for all you give the Edtech in terms of data, patterns, attention, cash, the convenience given inevitably falls short. There are no refunds on souls.

 I'm pretty sure that big-money Edtech is not actually going anywhere, but if it was up to me, I'd happily say "so long" to that Edtech.

## Dead!
Early pandemic, when faculty were scrambling to "pivot," most folks supporting faculty in higher ed (including myself) were all saying the same thing to anyone would would listen: 

An abrupt pivot to teaching online will obviously result in more online learning happening in the world, but their will be a huge amount of damage done to the goal of showing skeptics how online learning can be down well. You know, the kind that takes tons of time and care to execute properly.

Obviously, no one had that luxury, but I think it holds true regardless. Edtechs around the world who know that online teaching done well can be a good thing will be fighting to correct this for a long time, I suspect. The techno-solutionism sold from big Edtech is not helping in this regard, either. So much of what teachers think about whent they think of edtech is actually the surveillance filled, privacy destroying capital E kind.

This particular bit of [Martin Weller's post](http://blog.edtechie.net/edtech/reviewing-the-ed-tech-angst/) really struck home for me:
> They were suddenly called upon to keep the whole education show on the road. And largely, they managed to do that, often putting in stupid hours, sacrificing holidays and abandoning their own research and interests. And then when it was all over, there was a big parade to thank them. Well, no. They were [chastised in the media](http://blog.edtechie.net/higher-ed/why-do-education-secretaries-hate-online-learning/) for online education being on a par with stealing from the charity box outside a sweet shop. And many found that post-pandemic their views were not respected, but instead met with a ‚Äòthanks, but now we‚Äôve seen how important it is, we‚Äôre going to put a proper executive in charge‚Äô approach (not at the OU I should hasten to add, just things I‚Äôve picked up anecdotally). That kind of stuff can get a person down.

I was lucky enough to be working on a fantastic team at SNC, and for an amazing director, so my burnout was less than most, but the post-pandemic feeling of "yeah we've seen your online learning, and don't want it" was real. I've had the privilege of working with a lot of amazing teachers both at Reclaim and SNC how don't think this way, but sometimes it's the naysayers that stick with you.

## Welcome to the Black Parade

So where does that leave us? Is it just doom and gloom? Well, you might be hard pressed to pick up on it given my rambling in this post, but I'm generally optimistic.
