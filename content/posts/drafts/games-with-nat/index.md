Video games have been my entertainment medium of choice for a long, long, time, and probably the pop culture *thing* that I'm most knowledgeable about. It sort of depends on what you mean by "knowledgeable," obviously. I'm not a game developer, just someone who not only enjoys playing games, but enjoys learning about game design, reading about / watching videos about game history and preservation, and keeps up with new stuff in the industry.
