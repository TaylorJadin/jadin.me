This is my second week working at Reclaim Hosting as their Community Instructional Technologist. Itâ€™s been fantastic getting to meet the team, tiring getting my work from home set up just the way I like it[^1], and invigorating getting to dive right into a bunch of new stuff. Itâ€™s already been amazing making Domains my day job, something which I loved helping with at SNC so much.

Iâ€™m still very much in the onboarding phase here, so I have a ton of stuff to learn and new information coming at me daily, which Iâ€™m particularly enjoying and feels new in a way that Iâ€™m not used to. Itâ€™s not like I wasnâ€™t used to diving into new stuff at SNC, thatâ€™s basically part of a technologistâ€™s job description, but in case I donâ€™t mean technical stuff. What's different for me is learning how this team handleâ€™s the day-to-day important stuff, how communication works, etc. I havenâ€™t really had to get comfortable in an entirely new work environment since I started my first full-time position at SNC. So far the team here has been extremely welcoming and organized, so that's made things easy ðŸ˜Š

[^1]: Iâ€™m extremely picky about such things, I have a whole seperate post about this in the works
