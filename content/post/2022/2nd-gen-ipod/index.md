This is hilariously possible and still supported to this day in macOS:

{{< figure src="IMG_0005.jpeg" title="A second generation iPod plugged in to my 14\" 2021 Macbook Pro" >}}

{{< figure src="IMG_0006.jpeg" title="The adapter disaster that made it happen." >}}

{{< figure src="finder ipod.jpeg" title="The iPod shows up in Finder for syncing music!" >}}

All it took was the following adapters and cables that no sane person should own (that I still have lying around):
* Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter
* Thunderbolt 2 to Firewire 800 adapter
* Firewire 800 to Firewire 400 cable
