Yesterday, I climbed into my attic using a ladder from my garage (wearing slippers and pajamas) to swap out a Wifi AP.

I actually did a full upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 with no downtime using [Ubiquiti Fast Roaming](https://evanmccann.net/blog/2021/11/unifi-advanced-wi-fi-settings), so that while the new AP booted up devices would seamlessly switch over to the other AP in my house. This was important because I didn’t want the Google Home in my daughter’s room that plays white noise while she sleeps to stop playing white noise.

Do I get some kind of parenting award, or demerit for stupidity?
