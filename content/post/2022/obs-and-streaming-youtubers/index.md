I've talking amount about OBS setups, cameras and mics, and other recording and streaming stuff with [Jim](https://bavatuesdays.com) and [Pilot](https://pilotirwin.com/) quite a bit recently as part of [Instructional Tech](https://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-edtech/) stufff at Reclaim. Recently, I shared with them some of my favorite streaming and OBS focused Youtube channels. I thought it might be handy to note those here as well.

## [Alpha Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCATWC1JSlhzmYeDbjnS8WwA)

I really like the Alpha Gaming channel, Harris focuses a lot on game streaming career stuff that I donâ€™t personally care about, but I think he has a pretty good picture of what gear related problems exist and need to be solved in the space. He also has a background in audio engineering which does come across when he talks about audio stuff:

## [EposVox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBHiacaQb5S70pljtJYB2g)

The EposVox channel is fantastic, and goes very deep into capture cards, mics, sometimes cameras, and retro stuff. I really like the breadth of things he covers, and I think he does a pretty good job of covering more broad needs than just game streaming when relavant to the particular product he's talking about.

He's also put out an OBS Studio "Master Class" that seems great, though I've only watched a few parts of it so far. I think it could be a great in depth tutorial for folks who want that:
