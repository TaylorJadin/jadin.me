I've talking amount about OBS setups, cameras and mics, and other recording and streaming stuff with [Jim](https://bavatuesdays.com) and [Pilot](https://pilotirwin.com/) quite a bit recently as part of [Instructional Tech](https://bavatuesdays.com/reclaim-edtech/) stufff. Recently, I shared with them some of my favorite streaming and OBS focused Youtube channels. I thought it might be handy to note those here as well.

## [Alpha Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCATWC1JSlhzmYeDbjnS8WwA)

I really like the Alpha Gaming channel, Harris focuses a lot on game streaming career stuff that I donâ€™t personally care about, but I think he has a pretty good picture of what gear related problems exist and need to be solved in the space. He also has a background in audio engineering which does come across when he talks about audio stuff:

## [EposVox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBHiacaQb5S70pljtJYB2g)

The EposVox channel is fantastic, and goes very deep into capture cards, mics, sometimes cameras, and retro stuff. I really like the breadth of things he covers, and I think he does a pretty good job of covering more broad needs than just game streaming when relavant.
