Yesterday I did a little stream over on [live.jadin.me](https://live.jadin.me) sort of documenting what I learned getting [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) set up on Reclaim Cloud. I learned a great deal about the idiosynrasies of different Docker containers, mapping extra storage containers etc.

Recording is below!
