At the end of the day today I streamed a little bit of me playing around with [Kasm Worskpaces](https://www.kasmweb.com/) on Reclaim Cloud:

The tool seems interesting and it has been on my list of things to look into for a little while. It's basically a self-hostable Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS), like Citrix or Amazon Appstream, but for Linux Desktops and applications. Also, it has a free version!

Under the hood it all runs on Docker, which is how I found out about it. I stumbled on this [curious image on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kasmweb/doom#!) last week and had to try it out:

<video style="max-width:100%" autoplay loop muted controls>
	<source src="kasm-doom.mp4">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Honestly, to my suprise I was able to succesfully get it working in the timespan of a 40 minute stream ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
